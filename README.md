# 💊 RevengeTweak

![GitHub Workflow Status (with event)](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/revenge-mod/revenge-tweak/release.yml)
![Open Software License 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-OSL%20v3-yellow.svg)

Tweak to inject [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod/Revenge) into Discord. Forked [BunnyTweak](https://github.com/pyoncord/BunnyTweak), modified to match with [RevengeXposed](https://github.com/revenge-mod/Revenge-xposed) behavior. There are still slight differences between these two, and this tweak may be missing some loader features.

# Notice
This branch will be used for my custom builds of revenge, they include:
- Normal Revenge ipa updated to latest discord version
- Revenge + [DiscordNoTrack](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/DiscordNoTrack) + [OpenDiscordSafariExtension](https://github.com/BillyCurtis/OpenDiscordSafariExtension)

> [!NOTE]
> As of right now this tweak does not encompass some functionalities when running in a jailed environment with a wildcard certificate \
> If you value these features sign the application with a local dev certificate:
> - setAlternateAppIcon does not work, thus breaking dynamic app icons
> - sharing files to the application/selecting items via the Files app does not work

## 🔽 Installation

Builds can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-tweak/releases/latest) tab.

### Jailbroken

1. Install the Orion runtime via your preferred package manager, by adding `https://repo.chariz.com/` to your sources, then finding `Orion Runtime`.
1. Install Revenge by downloading the appropriate Debian package (or by building your own, see [Building RevengeTweak locally](#building-revengetweak-locally)) and adding it to your package manager. Use the file ending in `arm.deb` for rootful jailbreaks, and the file ending in `arm64.deb` for rootless jailbreaks.

> [!NOTE]
> TrollStore may display an encryption warning, which you can disregard.

1. Download and install [Revenge.ipa](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-tweak/releases/latest/download/Revenge.ipa) using your preferred sideloading method.

## 🛠️ Building RevengeTweak locally

> [!NOTE]
> These steps assume you use MacOS.

1. Install Xcode from the App Store. If you've previously installed the `Command Line Utilities` package, you will need to run `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` to make sure you're using the Xcode tools instead.

> If you want to revert the `xcode-select` change, run `sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk`

2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running `brew install make ldid` in your terminal. If you do not have brew installed, follow the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

3. Setup your path accordingly. We recommend you run the following before running the next commands, as well as any time you want to build RevengeTweak.

```bash
export PATH="$(brew --prefix make)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
# feel free to set whatever path you want, but it needs to be a direct path, without relative parts
export THEOS="/Users/vendetta/IPA/theos"
```

4. Setup [theos](https://theos.dev/docs/installation-macos) by running the script provided by theos.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theos/theos/master/bin/install-theos)"
```

If you've already installed theos, you can run `$THEOS/bin/update-theos` to make sure it's up to date.

5. Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:revenge-mod/RevengeTweak.git` and `cd` into it. Replace the URL with your fork if you've forked this repository.

6. To build RevengeTweak, you can run `rm -rf packages && make clean && make package FINALPACKAGE=1 && make package FINALPACKAGE=1 THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=rootless`. The first command will remove any previous packages, the second will clean the project, the third will build the rootful package (which is denoted by the `arm.deb` ending), and the fourth will build the rootless package (which is denoted by the `arm64.deb` ending).

The first time you run this, it might take a bit longer, but subsequent builds should be much faster.

The resulting `.deb` files will be in the `packages` folder. As a reminder, `*arm.deb` is for rootful jailbreaks and sideloading, and `*arm64.deb` is for rootless jailbreaks.

## 📙 Contributing

If you want to contribute, you will basically need to follow the steps for [Building RevengeTweak locally](#building-revengetweak-locally), as well as run `make spm` for the Swift LSP to work.
